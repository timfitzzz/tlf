* [f536908e035bc1838764f6eb4c093139cdf68dac](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/commits/f536908e035bc1838764f6eb4c093139cdf68dac): Adjusted README.md and added validation to prevent predictable use of # at beginning of channel name

Resolves #42.  
* [9732ca62c810bf30482be02415e00fad1a871143](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/commits/9732ca62c810bf30482be02415e00fad1a871143): Added tooltips for transport buttons and close channel button. That's enough for now. Resolved #43.

Elected to maintain this on a per-channel basis. Open to changing this.  
* [187f0172bb71578750b840a8779ef26f874f8f4e](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/commits/187f0172bb71578750b840a8779ef26f874f8f4e): Resolved #41: used min-width to force mainview divider to match the set x coordinate.  
* [03959bcda81ab7d1184873f917a30f09aac945a1](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/commits/03959bcda81ab7d1184873f917a30f09aac945a1): Steps towards addressing #38: handling error if channel join fails.

[timfitzzz](https://github.com/timfitzzz) opened 17 issues in [timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher)  
* [Clip-level SpecialBadge incorrectly calculates empowered vs regular users when there's only one user](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/49): This bug was resolved on the stack level. Migrate to new proxied selectors.  
* [VoteCounts can exceed popover dimensions](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/48): If there are too many votes to represent, votecount popovers can exceed viewable size. Handle more appropriately.  
* [WhenAgo isn't always updating](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/47): Under certain circumstances, clips don't seem to be updating their start epochs. Switch from doing this in the whenago badge on a per-clip basis to something more global and regular.  
* ["Getting Started" panel on Add Channel tab](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/46): Should display a quick suggested rundown of how to get started:
  
  1. Enter your Twitch account name in the box above and click the plus button.
  2. Select your channel above. Clips posted in your chat will be aggregated in this pane.
  3. Let your chatters and mods know they can:
    - **Add clips** by posting links in the chat
    - **Tag clips** by posting a link and adding words
    - **Mark clips** as "meta" or "drama" by adding those words to messages containing the link, or replies to messages that contain the link
    - _Mods:_ **veto** clips by adding the word "veto" to their replies or linking messages.
  4. Either put ClipsTime! on stream and play clips on the right-hand player pane, or pop the player out into a separate window, and use that full-screen while controlling playback from here.  
* [Demo screenshots: zoom on click](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/45): Probably just a fullscreen popover component would do the trick.  
* [Locked Clips count doesn't display properly (icon is missing)](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/44): Not sure what happened but the locked clips display is missing the lock (and the text is accordingly too large). Needs fixing.  
* [Add some basic descriptive tooltips](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/43): Need a few basic tooltips:
  
  - Record/Pause
  - Lock
  - Clear
  - Close Channel
  - Sort Icons
  - Add Channel  
* [Add "Mobile doesn't work" indicator](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/42): If the user visits on a mobile device, the site should gracefully let them know that we don't support mobile devices yet. This needs to be done in such a way that it doesn't interfere with desktop users' window manipulation.  
* [MainView divider position somewhat to left of where it's supposed to be](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/41): For some reason, the MainView divider lags behind the cursor when dragging to set its position. Troubleshoot and resolve.  
* [Explore anonymous chat client use and pull back OIDC grant if possible](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/40): Right now, the OIDC grant requests read and write permissions for chat, even though we have not implemented any of the possible write functionality on the roadmap (#12). Since twitch-chat-client provides an anonymous connection option, let's see if we can use that and remove chat from the oauth scope.  
* [Previously-watched clips reset when changing channel tab](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/39): Changing channel tabs clears the previously-watched clips list. The previously-watched state should be global and persistent.  
* [Validate channel name on initial input](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/38): Right now you can put whatever you want into the channels box; you'll get an error on console if the join fails, but that's it. Need to handle this with an error message and avoid adding the channel.  
* [- It would be nice to be able to identify other streamers' perspectives as being pertinent to the same event. If we deviate from the current browser-only approach, there's a bunch of ways we can do this. In the meantime, limited to the client and excluding audio and video content, maybe we can correlate thumbnails. Or, we can provide chat API (and eventually GUI support) for channel mods or chatters to relate clips to one another, across streamers.](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/37)  
* [Test meta/drama/veto handling](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/36): Run through some scenarios and make sure it all makes sense from the end user perspective.  
* [Improving event detection](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/35): Right now events are discovered in a very simple way:
  
  1. All channel clips are sorted chronologically
  2. The chronological list of clips is examined in chronological order. If one clips shares a broadcaster and overlaps in time with the prior clip (or group of clips), it is put in a group (stack).
  
  This is good enough to reduce a ton of redundancy, and to identify very popular moments. But there are a number of situations where one would like it to be smarter:
  
  [ ] - Sometimes Broadcaster B's clip just happens to coincide in time with a overlapping set of Broadcaster A's clips. This winds up splitting the stack of Broadcaster A's clip in the UI. It's the most noticeable limitation of the current algorithm. Some possible mitigations:
    1. Look backwards one more item when finding stacks. This will solve the issue if there's only one broadcaster that overlaps the stack, but to solve 2, we must look backwards two more, etc -- at some point we're getting closer to doing n^2 comparisons rather than n.
    2. A better solution: stack the clips on a per-broadcaster basis, rather than as an entire list. Then, sort the result. This turns n into 2n.
  [ ] - It would be nice to be able to identify other streamers' perspectives as being pertinent to the same event.

* [Chat API change: require +/- as api prefix](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/34): Tags make less sense when they're every and any word, and the way people use words like "meta" and "drama" in sentences made it very possible for a user to tag a clip as meta or drama by saying e.g. "this is not drama" or "this is not meta". Adding a plus or minus helps reduce this ambiguation and dovetails with issue #19.  
* [If clip has been deleted, player pane just remains blank](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/33): Should detect failure of the embed to load if possible, and display a failure message to indicate what's going on.  

[timfitzzz](https://github.com/timfitzzz) created 2 comments on issue [If clip has been deleted, player pane just remains blank](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/33) in [timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher)  
* [item](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/33#issuecomment-889286590): Since we're already pulling updates for all the clips, we need to find a way to also check for clips that don't exist. Currently, non-existent clips are simply missing from the reply. We'll need to compare the results to the query to find requested clips that were not returned, then we'll need to mark them as unplayable, and provide a way for user to clear from the list.  
* [item](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/33#issuecomment-887055002): The Twitch clips embed doesn't seem to provide any type of error handling, nor emit any distinguishable error when a clip fails to load. There might be an API-based solution. Bumping this to 1.0 due to the infrequency of the issue and the complexity of implementing a solution.

* This is tough because there's no real "search for user by partial string API" endpoint that I'm aware of. One workaround could be to get the user's followed channels and use that list as the autocomplete dictionary, with an option for "manually add". In the meantime, the fix deployed should prevent the bug case, so I'm switching this to enhancement and pushing it to 1.0.
