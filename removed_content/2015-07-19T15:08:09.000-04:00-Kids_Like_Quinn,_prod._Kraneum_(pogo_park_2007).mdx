description: "Thomas “Quinn” Quinn was a troubled man.  He’d been terminally ill 14 years by the time I moved into the Back Bay apartment he shared with his girlfriend and a professional trumpeter, Evan.  Evan had lived there for some time before I arrived, but he and I had both ended up at 38 Westland Ave via very friendly Craigslist ads.  We were both in over our heads with the situation, and we watched with doe-eyed shock as Quinn drugged himself into a nightly stupor.
It was the first time I’d been in the presence of a serious drug addict, but the situation was complicated by his illness and so I tried not to overreact.  His girlfriend, Tara, took care of him (with what still seems an unfathomable amount of dedication and durability) and kept his (their) problems mostly behind closed doors.  Still, it went without saying what was going on behind those doors, and yet we lived our busy lives, went to class, work, socialized.  We three had an unspoken agreement to accept Quinn’s decision-making process as something we simply could not possibly understand.   How could we begrudge Quinn a sense of impermanence?  It was just obviously not our place to tell him how to value, how to protect his life.
“Kids Like Quinn” is the true story of one night on Westland when things came to a head.  Quinn nearly died, paramedics were called, anxiety attacks were had.  Evan and I were really knocked out of our complacence by these events, and we eventually all moved out and went our separate ways.
I ran into Evan at the Hynes T station a few years after I wrote and recorded this track, and he asked me if I had heard about Quinn.  I hadn’t.  He told me that Quinn had finally passed after overdosing.  Apparently Tara was doing well for herself, though, which was quite a relief to hear.  
In 2009 I refixed the choruses a bit and brought it to a state I was comfortable with people hearing.  That’s the version I’ve posted here.  RIP, Quinn.  You certainly made a big impression on me.  Thanks."
