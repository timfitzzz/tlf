* [Improve Sorting Interface](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/18): - [ ] The sorting interface is too small. It should be easier to understand if brought to same size as first row of controls / stats in toolbar.
  - [ ] Change hover cursor to indicate toggle & drag
  - [ ] Consider (i) icon popover to explain  
* [Auto-refresh page views](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/17): Wire up existing page view refresh functionality to automatically refresh views every ~30s.  
* [Favorites](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/16): User should be able to save favorites
  
  - [ ] Save clips as favorites
  - [ ] Add favorites tab
  - [ ] Save favorites to local storage  
* [Export / Import Annotations](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/15): Provide option to export / import annotations as JSON.  
* [Save / load state in LocalStorage](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/14): Save currently-known clips, annotations, and UI state in LocalStorage and automatically reload upon next use of the application.  
* [Stats and help in Player Pane](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/13): - [ ] Give PlayerPane the ability to display info / credit for submitters / moderators who help provide clips
  - [ ] Add option for PlayerPane to display guidance for using commands in chat  
* [Moderation Functionality in-app (WRITE to chat)](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/12): Display buttons in UI for moderators/broadcasters to send moderation feedback directly in the application.  
* [Add README](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/11): Create readme for this repo that contains basic information about how to use and to help develop the application  
* [Google Analytics](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/10): Implement GA. Also, change the page title while you're at it  
* [Add help popovers](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/9): When help button in topbar is selected, display modal with popovers.
  
  - Clips List
  - Sorter / Stack Button
  - On top of PlayerPane display "About" equivalent
  - Login/Logout
  - Link to Chat API documentation  
* [Implement Veto function](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/8): Implement veto functionality:
  
  - [ ] Fade vetoed clips out in ClipsList and prevent playback
  - [ ] For broadcaster/mods, add button to reverse veto (sends -veto)
  - [ ] For non-broadcaster/mods, add button to reveal clip temporarily.  
* [Implement Meta and Drama badges](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/7): Meta and drama tags need to be implemented as on-clip badges with details in popover.  
* [Tags display](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/6): Tags are currently displayed in a rudimentary form in a panel alongside the associated clip.
  
  - [ ] Move tags to a summary badge atop clip thumbnail
  - [ ] Implement popover display containing details  
* [Test and document chat API](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/5): Test and document the following all-user features:
  
  - [ ] _+1_ / _-1_ to annotate with up or down vote
  - [ ] _meta_ or _drama_ to suggest meta or drama tags
  - [ ] other words
  
  Test and document the following moderator/broadcaster-only features:
  
  - [ ] _veto_ to gray out a clip
  - [ ] _-meta_ / _-drama_  / _-veto_ to undo self-issued special tags
  
  It's likely that additional issues will be discovered during this process.  
* [Message Removal](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/4): When moderators time out users or clear individual messages from chat, remove those messages and their effects from ClipsTime.  
* [PlayerPane: Pop out](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/3): Player pane should be able to pop out of the primary frame, so that it can be full-screened on a separate display.  
* [Clip Stacks](https://github.com/timfitzzz/twitch-clipcatcher/issues/2): **Feature:** Display simultaneous clips in "stack" with buttons to 'surface' clips by feature: shortest, longest, most views, most votes.
  
  Requirements:
  - [ ] Implement in useClips hook (change API to output array of clipId arrays)
    - [ ] Address second-order impacts of useClips API change
  - [ ] Display in clips list with combined stats, tags, and selection buttons:
    - Shortest clip
    - Longest clip
    - Most-viewed clip
    - Most-voted-for clip
