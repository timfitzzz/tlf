[timfitzzz](https://github.com/timfitzzz) pushed 3 commits to refs/heads/main in [timfitzzz/tlf](https://github.com/timfitzzz/tlf)  
* [1da29b1604be7482d00a05b7d9d1147c5debc78e](https://github.com/timfitzzz/tlf/commits/1da29b1604be7482d00a05b7d9d1147c5debc78e): Fixed some display issues. Tweaked project buttons on the front page. Removed Soundcloud items from I/O due to breaking API changes. We'll need to implement some cloud functions to handle displaying the SC widget. The collector, too, but given my current music output it probably doesn't deserve a front-burner slot on the agenda.
