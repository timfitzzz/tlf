title: "A Little Trust, prod. Kraneum (pogo park 2007)"
date: 2015/07/19 19:08:09 +0000
description: "In 2006 I found myself in a strange and beautiful city (Seattle) working 18 hour days on a labor of love. One of my fellow grunts, Jamal, was a local.  He was also a really amazingly talented producer by the name of Kraneum. He gave me a grip of beats, many unfinished, with the intent of starting a long-term collaboration. We decided to make an album entitled GOLD NUGGETS, a pun on our lead organizer’s terrible pep talks. We also planned to include a song drawing heavily from the 1-800-Free-Conference-Calls’ “hold” music.  (It was a heady time to be sure.)

Each night after work I would return to my borrowed basement-level apartment overlooking Portage Bay and I would record demo tracks over Kraneum’s beats. Every bit of the passion, tension, hope, and exhaustion of the gig was processed via these dark, synthy, swelling compositions. Looking back, my writing reflected a feeling of resolution that can only be had at day’s end when you’ve “left it all on the road” and have absolutely nothing left to give except to yourself.  
By the time the job ended 40-odd days later, work had started on about 10 tracks, and I returned to Providence to finish writing and recording.  Providence, I would later realize, is totally out of its mind, so while I did continue work on our project… well, I mean, I was in an all-consuming new environment and I was definitely changing, which is a major theme of this track. Several new Kraneum-produced demos came out of my time in Providence, but as my time in Seattle drifted out of the rearview, work on the old ones gradually slowed to a pause.  A very, very long pause.  Using the word “pause” in the same sense as in the fact that the Korean War is technically still being “fought”.

Anyway, “A Little Trust” was one of the few of our tracks to actually come to some sort of finish in Providence.  (“Kids Like Quinn” was another one.  See my first post.)  There is one more track that saw any kind of hand-to-hand distribution, but I’ll save that for another day.

My old friend Drew Simenson lent the ending vocals (recorded surreptitiously during a cipher session) and a Grüvis Malt track lent the title.  The opening vocal melody and lyrics are in tribute to a very moving adaptation of a hymn composed by an old friend."
