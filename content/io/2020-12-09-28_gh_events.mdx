  - [timfitzzz](https://github.com/timfitzzz) closed an issue: [getUserByKey](https://github.com/johnpduane/confluence-api/issues/18) 
    > Hey there,  
    >   
    > I've implemented a getUserByKey function, added documentation, and created a test (which needs a valid userKey to be added to pass, but which otherwise should). I've never submitted a pull request before, but it seems like I need permission to create the branch and then submit the request -- or let me know if there's some other way you'd rather I submitted.  
    >   
    > Thanks for building this, it's been super helpful!
