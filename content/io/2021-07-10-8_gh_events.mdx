* The vote count badge needs rethinking. The frogs thing was cute, but devising a new color coding system for a single icon shape when there's an existing Twitch visual lexicon doesn't make sense. New plan:
  
  * Different icons for user classes: 
   * Broadcaster: camera icon, red outline (like Twitch)
   * Mods: scale/justice icon (not like Twitch; I hate that the mod icon there is a sword), green outline (like Twitch)
   * VIP: diamond icon w/ magentaish outline (like twitch)
   * Sub: star icon w/ purple outline (like twitch's default)
   * User: just a very cute gray box.
  
  Would be cool to use channel's icons at some point.
  
  And then the entire thing needs an icon that can stand in for it in the sorter -- might be that @styled-icons/fa-solid/VoteYea could work. Wonder if this should go on the badge/widget itself too.
