* [provide option for fixed character width in plaintext to (somewhat) more sensitively wrap text and preserve indentation.](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/10): plaintext lines can be too long to not wrap, but wrapping post-rendering also means breaking indentation. if we know how many characters to wrap at, we can preserve indentation.  
* [setting indentContent=false, md=true leads to a lack of line breaks](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/9): the issue seems to be the same as #8 -- an additional space needs to be added at the end of lines. (when there is an additional line break (a paragraph break), you get the end of the line break for free).
  
  markdown is:

  `
    
* [allow setting start day of week for groupByDays](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/7): [the grouping code already accommodates this](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/blob/5fad440bd7ef6077b4ad3a44e4574dcbd994ece4/src/collectPropSets.ts#L133); it just needs to be routed through from renderEvents and added to NaiveConfig.   
* [sortBy doesn't work](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/6): it doesn't seem to do anything.  
* [CreateEvent/DeleteEvent: collapsed branches described by "item" instead of branch name](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/5): output:

  ```
  
  yes, they're both main. not sure if this is related to the issue.
    
* [CreateEvent erroneously targeting payload under certain circumstances](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/4): Here's the bad string output:
  
  "WENDELL-ARAUJO created a repository payload.ref in WENDELL-ARAUJO/WENDELL-ARAUJO"
  
  Here is the source event:
  
  `
  {
    "id": "15568616979",
    "type": "CreateEvent",
    "actor": {
      "id": 59621601,

    },
    "repo": {
      "id": 348508896,

    },
    "payload": {
      "ref": null,
      "ref_type": "repository",

    },
    "public": true,
    "created_at": "2021-03-16T22:24:13Z"
  }
  `
  
  This is happening because naive is checking for the truthiness of the path, or using the included text. When the action type is repository, payload.ref is apparently absent. This can be resolved by using custom definitions for each action type.  
* [Fall back to "result" verbiage instead of generic "item" when there is no title to link to in the case of multiple items](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/3): A longer-term fix for #2.
  
  Instead of falling back to the generic term "item" when there is no title or date to use as the intro link for multiple subjects in a single rendered event group, use the singular value of the event type's "result" property.
  
  See also: #1   
* [Multiple pull request comments are entitled with "item"](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/2): This case is similar to #1 but is a little harder to improve. It manifests when the current default configuration includes:
  ```
  {
    md: true,
    dateContent: false
  }
  ```
  
  Again, this happens because while there is a value suitable for id, there is not a value suitable for title. Still, we're using the id in the summary text for these comments. So we'll set it as the title as well, which will at least provide something to link to.
  
  A future approach could be to fall back to the single "result" value, i.e. "comment" instead of "title". This will need a refactor. I will create an improvement issue for this.  
* [Multiple push comments are entitled with "item" rather than sha hash](https://github.com/timfitzzz/naive-gh-events/issues/1): Currently, multiple push comments are entitled with "item" (the default text) instead of the sha hash (which is long).
  
  This happens because the current PushEvent definition provides only an id, and not a title, for commit subjects. The current content rendering function does not accept the id, leaving it with nothing to link the commit comment to (except for the date, which shows up if "dateContent" is set).
  
  A longer-term fix would allow providing a transformer function instead of the current static-only mapping of event object values to the naive event model.
  
  In the short term, we will assign the sha as the title for commit subjects.
